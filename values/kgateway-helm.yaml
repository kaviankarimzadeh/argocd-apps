# -- List of namespace selectors (OR'ed): each entry can use 'matchLabels' or 'matchExpressions' (AND'ed within each entry if used together).

# -- Map of GatewayClass names to GatewayParameters references that will be set on
#    the default GatewayClasses managed by kgateway. Each entry must define both the
#    name and namespace of the GatewayParameters resource.
#    The default GatewayClasses managed by kgateway are:
#    - kgateway
#    - kgateway-waypoint
#    Example:
#    gatewayClassParametersRefs:
#      kgateway:
#        name: shared-gwp
#        namespace: kgateway-system
# gatewayClassParametersRefs:
#   kgateway:
#     name: kgateway-custom
#     namespace: kgateway-system
